                <h4>Vegetable prep</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Slice the onions in half such that the root is sliced in half and remove the outer skin. Place the flat side of the onion on the cutting board and slice evenly. Discard the root and set aside.</li>

                    <li>Peel all of the garlic and discard the peels. Roughly chop the garlic and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Wash the Tomatos and remove the stems and leaves. Slice in half. </li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Meat prep</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Salt your chuck/brisket 24 hours in advance. Use about a tablespoon for every 8oz of meat</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Cooking Instructions</h3>
                <h4>Braise the meat</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Slice up your chuck/brisket into 3 inch chunks</li>
                    <li>In the Dutch oven, heat up about 4 tablespoons of oil and about 1 tablespoon of butter oven medium high heat</li>
                    <li>When smoking, sear each chunk for about 3 minutes per side, allowing to brown evenly.</li>
                    <li>Set aside the browned meat.</li>
                    <li>Once the meat is braised, pour excess oil into a prep bowl, reserving about a tablespoon of fat in the dutch oven.</li>
                    <li>Lower the heat to medium. Add in the diced onion, fennel, and garlic and saute for about 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Add in the tomatoes. Continue sauteing until the mixture becomes a loose paste, around 15 minutes</li>
                    <li>Return the braised meat to the dutch oven.</li>
                    <li>Using the kitchen twine, tie together the herbs and add to the braise.</li>
                    <li>Add in the bay leaf.</li>
                    <li>Pour about 375ml of red wine into the dutch oven. Add water till meat is peeking out from the liquid. Reduce heat to low. Cover with lid</li>
                    <li>Braise on low to medium low for about 75 minutes. Add water as necessary if too much liquid evaporates. You may check every 25 minutes or so.</li>
                    <li>After 75 minutes, check to see if you can shread a piece using two forks. Once tender, set aside to cool down.</li>
                    <li>Shred the meat and mix with the braising liquid. Season with salt and pepper as necessary.</li>
                    <li>For best results, let the braise stand overnight.</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Lasagna Prep</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>In the stock pot, boil 11 quarts of salted water.</li>
                    <li>Preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit</li>
                    <li>Warm up the braised meat over the stove.</li>
                    <li>Once at a rolling boil, add in lasagna noodles and boil for about 5 minutes. Immediately remove and rinse under cold water to stop the cooking process.</li>
                    <li>In the baking tin, grease with about a tablespoon of olive oil.</li>
                    <li>Spread a thin layer of meat braise in the baking tin.</li>
                    <li>Arrange a layer lasagna noodles.</li>
                    <li>Spread another layer of the braised meat</li>
                    <li>Sprinkle pargmiggiano on top of the meat braise and layer on a layer of Mozzarella.</li>
                    <li>Tear basil and sprinkle on top of the cheese layer</li>
                    <li>Build about 4 layers, alternating between noodle, braised meat, cheese, and basil. </li>
                    <li>Bake in the oven for about 20 minutes, allowing the top layer to brown.</li>
                </ol>
