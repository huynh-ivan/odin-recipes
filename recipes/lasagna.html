        <h4>Vegetable prep</h4>
        <ol>

            <li>Wash the Tomatos and remove the stems and leaves. Slice in half. </li>

        <h4>Meat prep</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Salt your chuck/brisket 24 hours in advance. Use about a tablespoon for every 8oz of meat</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cooking Instructions</h3>
        <h4>Braise the meat</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice up your chuck/brisket into 3 inch chunks</li>
            <li>In the Dutch oven, heat up about 4 tablespoons of oil and about 1 tablespoon of butter oven medium high heat</li>
            <li>When smoking, sear each chunk for about 3 minutes per side, allowing to brown evenly.</li>
            <li>Set aside the browned meat.</li>
            <li>Once the meat is braised, pour excess oil into a prep bowl, reserving about a tablespoon of fat in the dutch oven.</li>
            <li>Lower the heat to medium. Add in the diced onion, fennel, and garlic and saute for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add in the tomatoes. Continue sauteing until the mixture becomes a loose paste, around 15 minutes</li>
            <li>Return the braised meat to the dutch oven.</li>
            <li>Using the kitchen twine, tie together the herbs and add to the braise.</li>
            <li>Add in the bay leaf.</li>
            <li>Pour about 375ml of red wine into the dutch oven. Add water till meat is peeking out from the liquid. Reduce heat to low. Cover with lid</li>
            <li>Braise on low to medium low for about 75 minutes. Add water as necessary if too much liquid evaporates. You may check every 25 minutes or so.</li>
            <li>After 75 minutes, check to see if you can shread a piece using two forks. Once tender, set aside to cool down.</li>
            <li>Shred the meat and mix with the braising liquid. Season with salt and pepper as necessary.</li>
            <li>For best results, let the braise stand overnight.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Lasagna Prep</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In the stock pot, boil 11 quarts of salted water.</li>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit</li>
            <li>Warm up the braised meat over the stove.</li>
            <li>Once at a rolling boil, add in lasagna noodles and boil for about 5 minutes. Immediately remove and rinse under cold water to stop the cooking process.</li>
            <li>In the baking tin, grease with about a tablespoon of olive oil.</li>
            <li>Spread a thin layer of meat braise in the baking tin.</li>
            <li>Arrange a layer lasagna noodles.</li>
            <li>Spread another layer of the braised meat</li>
            <li>Sprinkle pargmiggiano on top of the meat braise and layer on a layer of Mozzarella.</li>
            <li>Tear basil and sprinkle on top of the cheese layer</li>
            <li>Build about 4 layers, alternating between noodle, braised meat, cheese, and basil. </li>
            <li>Bake in the oven for about 20 minutes, allowing the top layer to brown.</li>
        </ol>
